### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

###Add some links

I like [google](https://www.google.com)

I can link directly to my [about page](about.html)

###Using HTML to embed images
<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">
Must make an images folder in your project directory and then add the image to it (reduces clutter in the overall directory).
