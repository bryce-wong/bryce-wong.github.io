### About Bryce (she/her/hers):

MPH graduate and current data analyst at Crossix -  passionate about the social dynamics of public health, technology, and data.

My thesis explores the ethical implications of big data for public health. I propose the use of qualitative research methods to investigate:

  * The perceptions and agendas influencing biostatisticians and data scientists working in this field
  * How data infrastructures are designed and managed for health technology
  * The potential impact of such design and management choices on issues of normalization, oppression, and empowerment
