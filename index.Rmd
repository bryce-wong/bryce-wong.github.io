### About Bryce (she/her/hers):

MPH candidate interested in the social dynamics of public health, technology, and media.

My thesis explores the ethical implications of big data for public health. I'm primarily interested in using qualitative research methods to investigate:

* The perceptions and agendas influencing biostatisticians and computer scientists working in this field
* How data infrastructures are designed and managed for health technology
* The potential impact of such design and management choices on issues of normalization, oppression, and empowerment
