*	Perform ad hoc analyses with SQL using a diverse range of data sets, including EDI dental claims data, card transaction data, sessionized customer event data from web and mobile apps, and bi-temporal ledger data. 
*	Strategize cross-functionally with sales, finance, and operations teams to inform product roadmap through standing up core dashboards of key performance metrics, conducting quantitative analyses of pain points, and assembling qualitative findings based on interviews with stakeholders.
*	Partner with engineering to design a new reporting architecture, including collecting system requirements from a data modeling perspective, determining user stories to inform test cases, and reviewing warehousing frameworks to ensure robust analytical capabilities.
*	Develop and test dbt models for analytical use cases with dbt alerting for data health. Use Jinja macros to transform and document data stored as JSON blobs outputted from protobuf messages into BigQuery data structs. 
*	Implement custom Python ETLs using Kubernetes to extract data from third party APIs for analysis in Jupyter notebooks (including developing risk rules through assessing statistical performance metrics of  risk-related features). 
*	Led team in company-wide migration of data assets from Periscope to Looker, using LookML development to enable self-service analytics with engineers and non-technical stakeholders. Implemented trainings and office hours to familiarize teams with Looker for data-driven planning of team goals.
*	Core member of the DEIB+ team, creating virtual events and resource guides to educate and celebrate diversity across Level and customers.

#### Crossix, A Veeva Company | Senior Analyst, Marketing Analytics | June 2019 - January 2021
